KNOCK ME OUT NOW
THE GROUND I'M ON IS FAILING
ONE MORE HIT AND I GO DOWN
ALL I EVER SEE IS PRETTY FLOWER POWER
BUT YOU KNOW I'M REALLY STARVING
FOR THE OTHER SIDE
ALL I EVER HEAR IS CHATTER FLATTER HOUR
BUT YOU KNOW I'M REALLY HOPING
FOR A BETTER LINE
ALL I EVER BREATHE IS KIND OF BROKEN DOWN
BUT YOU KNOW I REALLY WANT TO
FIND A LITTLE TIME
ALL I EVER TASTE I WANT TO SPIT IT OUT
AND YOU KNOW I'M REALLY DYING
FOR A LITTLE LIGHT
SOMETIMES IT FEELS
THE MORE YOU WANT AND WANT IT
YOU GET CAUGHT AND FORGET IT'S NEVER REAL
SOMETIMES I FIND
I THINK I'M LOSING MY MIND
I GET CAUGHT AND FORGET IT'S NEVER REAL
HELLO GOODBYE
SEE AND TOUCH, THINK AND KNOW
FEEL, FORGET, BREATHE NOW BECAUSE
SOMETHING HAS GONE WRONG HERE, I SAID
MY FRIEND
THE SPACE I'M IN IS FADING
ONE MORE PUNCH WILL DO ME IN
DO IT FOR THE WIN
WHAT IS WRONG?
YOU'VE COME THIS FAR, NOW TAKE IT
ONE MORE KICK AND I'LL BE DONE
KICK ME, HAVE YOUR FUN
1234, I KNOW THE SCORE
5678, HEAR WHAT I SAY
ALL I EVER SAY I NEVER SAY IT LOUD
BUT IT'S LIKE I'M REALLY WAITING
FOR A BIGGER FIGHT
ALL I EVER FEEL I WANT TO SPIT IT OUT
AND IT'S LIKE I'M REALLY DYING
FOR A LITTLE LIGHT
SOMETIMES IT FEELS
THE MORE YOU WANT AND WANT IT
YOU GET CAUGHT AND FORGET IT'S NEVER REAL
SOMETIMES I KNOW
I KNOW THE MILES GET OLD,
WE GET CAUGHT AND FORGET IT'S NEVER REAL
GOODBYE HELLO
SEE AND TOUCH, THINK AND KNOW
FEEL, FORGET, BREATHE NOW BECAUSE
SOMETHING HAS GONE WRONG HERE, I SAID
MY FRIEND
THE SPACE I'M IN IS FADING
ONE MORE PUNCH WILL DO ME IN
DO IT FOR THE WIN
WHAT IS WRONG?
YOU'VE COME THIS FAR, NOW TAKE IT
ONE MORE KICK AND I'LL BE DONE
KICK ME, HAVE YOUR FUN
1234, I KNOW THE SCORE
5678, HEAR WHAT I SAY
NO DON'T DOUBT
THE GROUND I'M ON IS FAILING
ONE MORE HIT AND I GO DOWN
I GO DOWN
WHAT WAS RIGHT?
THIS PAST IS NOT WORTH SAVING
I DON'T WANT ANOTHER ROUND
NOTHING TO BE FOUND
WHAT IS WRONG?
THE PAST IS WHAT I'M CRAVING
BOTH MY FEET HAVE LEFT THE GROUND
NOWHERE TO BE FOUND
